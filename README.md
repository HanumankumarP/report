Registred users can get their previously searched data where as this option is not applicable for non-registered users. But If any accident happened near to the a person, the person can open the app and call the nearest hospital management without registering (for emergency cases).
So by using our application we can get the nearest hospital management phone numbers as well as police station details. He need to switch on his GPS to give location details, he can get the information based on his location. He can call to the phone members which he got from the list directly from the app.
